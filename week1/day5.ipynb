      "Check it out here:\n",
      "https://lnkd.in/dCY4w8MR\n",

      "The magic behind this is QLoRA.\n",
      "QLoRA enables efficient fine-tuning by tackling the two main sources of VRAM usage:\n",
      "\n",
      "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA): We freeze the large base model and inject small, trainable \"adapter\" matrices into its layers. Only these adapters are trained, reducing trainable parameters by >99%. This reduces the VRAM required for storing gradients and optimizer states (e.g., for Adam).\n",
      "Quantization (the \"Q\"): The frozen, multi-billion parameter base model is loaded using a quantized 4-bit data type. This dramatically reduces the memory footprint for storing the model's weights, making it feasible to fit much larger models into VRAM.\n",
      "\n",
      "But QLoRA isn't the only trick. We combined several optimizations to stay under 10GB:\n",
      "- 8-bit Adam Optimizer: Slashes optimizer memory by ~75%.\n",
      "- Gradient Checkpointing: Trades a bit of compute for huge memory savings.\n",
      "- Cached Latents & Embeddings: Pre-compute VAE and Text Encoder outputs so they're never in VRAM during training.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together with QLoRA these three tricks keep the whole fine-tune under 10 GB on a T4 or similar.\n",
